# Python Chatbot Overview

Welcome to Python Chatbot! Crafted by Kapilesh Pennichetty and Sanjay Balasubramanian, this program offers an interactive experience with the following features:

- **Wikipedia Article Summaries**: Fetch concise summaries of Wikipedia articles.
- **Weather Information**: Retrieve weather details for any location, either by auto-detecting the user's location via their external IP address or through manual input of a city name.
- **Interactive Storytelling**: Engage in an Interactive Story, where you, the user, dictate the character's responses to various scenarios.

**Note**: If opting for automatic location detection, please execute the program locally for accurate results. Disabling VPN or Internet Proxy is recommended for precise location determination.

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed on your system. If not, download and install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/).
